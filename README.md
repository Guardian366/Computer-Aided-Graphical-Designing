# Computer Aided Graphical Designing
 Intro class to CAGD at ASU

The class required linear Algebra and multivariable calculus to allow 3D and any other modelling of surfaces to be implemented in Mathematica.
The final project involved a 3D printable object designed from a different number of curves and techniques including Coons method.
